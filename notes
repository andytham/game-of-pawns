pseudo code

click on piece
determines possible moves (checks what piece type, color and pos)
add click events for those (remove every other one?) and add click on self to cancel and re add original clicks?

update the board after a confirm
  update image of source and target location
  replaces the image of location with source
 board in its own javascript file and we can use checkers, we should avoid using objects on the board because of so.
put

if i want to do objects
  8 x 4 objects or will I have each square as an object

  if I use objects only for the chess piece here are potential properties
    position x and y
    colors
    state (alive?)
    priority?
    change classes of the squares on the board
  this way we can use this method to move pieces around like so:
    update x and y when clicked in possible spot
    run an update function that first kills the piece in the way


  if i use objects for each chess square
    has chess piece in it

movesets

pawn
  can move two if first move
  can move one up or down
  can move diagonal if eating

  opposite values for black
rook
  can move anywhere vertically or horizontally unless there's something in front of it.
  will loop through incremented squares until it meets a square with a piece, if opposite color, that is as far as it can go, -1 if same color
bishop
  same as rook but col and row have to be increased equally
queen
  combined rook bishop
knight
  moves vertically or horizontally twice, then perpendicular once.
king
  queen but only 1 square out

logic for checking spots
  loop outwards from current square, and set square property to moveable so highlight
